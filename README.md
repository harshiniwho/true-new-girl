# true-new-girl
"True New Girl" based off how they play "True American" in the show.
This is basically a dataset of my favourite lines from the show as I slowly rewatch it for the fourth time. Tracking the images by:
1. the image name (image link in cloud)
2. the subtitles
3. the characters in the frame
4. the predominant visible emotions
5. the season and episode (matched from subtitles from the show script)
6. the timestamp of image creation
7. anything else I feel like tagging myself

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the images, they are simply off my habit of excessively screenshotting.


Character image notes:
1. cropped tran
2. replaced the images for Jamie Lee Curtis, young Joey King and Nick Kroll
