"True New Girl" based off how they play "True American" in the show.
This is basically a dataset of my favourite lines from the show as I slowly rewatch it for the fourth time. I plan on tracking the images by:
1. the image name
2. the subtitles
3. the characters in the frame
4. the predominant visible emotions
5. the season
6. anything else I feel like tagging myself

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the images, they are simply off my habit of excessively screenshotting.
